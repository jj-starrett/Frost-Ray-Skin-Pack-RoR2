# Frost Ray's Bona-fide Skin Pack
### Description
Hey all you cool guys and gals, have I got a skin pack for you. In fact it's so cool, it only has ~~one~~ ~~two~~ three skins!

The pack currently adds one new skin to Bandit, one new skin to Mercenary, and one new skin to Huntress but hopefully I'll get to adding a few more - all of them green, of course.
