# Frost Ray's Bona-fide Skin Pack
### Description
Hey all you cool guys and gals, have I got a skin pack for you. In fact it's so cool, it only has ~~one~~ ~~two~~ three skins!

The pack currently adds one new skin to Bandit, one new skin to Mercenary, and one new skin to Huntress but hopefully I'll get to adding a few more - all of them green, of course.

*NOTE: As of Version 1.2.3, skins should be compatible with Survivors of the Void

Highly recommend you check them out if you'd like to make your own skins!

### Feedback

If there's a skin idea you'd like to see, feel free to send me a PM on Reddit [@Frost_Ray](https://www.reddit.com/user/Frost_Ray/). Can't guarantee I'll get to it, but if I end up using your idea, I'll give you your very own mention in the credits - pretty exciting! 
Or, hey, if you've got some feedback on the existing skins - say, you were mauled by foxes as a young child and the sight of the _Kitsune_ skin is an affront to your being - feel free to let me know that too!
